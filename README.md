# 🎮 Project Overview

untitled-game is a multiplayer social game that blends teamwork, deception, and dynamic gameplay in a stylized environment. Players are split into teams with hidden roles and unique objectives, encouraging both cooperation and strategic thinking.

One team must blend in, disguise themselves, and avoid detection — while the other team works together to uncover and eliminate them. The match evolves in real time as players gather clues, complete objectives, and interact with the environment to shift the balance of power.

The game supports co-op multiplayer with flexible match sizes and host-client architecture.

## 🔑 Key Features

- 👥 **Multiplayer with hidden roles** — each round is different depending on team dynamics and player behavior.  
- 🕵️ **Stealth and strategy** — disguise yourself or uncover the disguised using tools and observation.  
- 🤝 **Cooperative gameplay** — work together with teammates, or pretend to.  
- 🌍 **Interactive environment** — the map offers dynamic elements that can be used for hiding, revealing, or manipulating gameplay.  
- 🧠 **Social deduction** — use logic, intuition, and conversation to outsmart others.
