🛠 Contribution Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Please follow the guidelines below to help us maintain a clean and consistent codebase.

📁 Branches
Use main as the stable branch — do not commit directly to it.
Create a new feature or fix branch from main for each contribution:
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
Name your branches using the pattern:
feature/xyz, fix/xyz, or chore/xyz.
✏️ Commits
Write clear, concise commit messages in English.
Use conventional commit style if possible (optional but recommended):
feat: add user login screen
fix: correct player movement on mobile
chore: update dependencies
🔁 Pull Requests
Make a pull request from your branch to main.
PR title should describe what the change does (e.g. Fix enemy AI pathfinding).
Keep PRs focused and small. One PR = one feature or fix.
Include a short description of what you changed and why.
Link any relevant issues (if applicable).
✅ Reviews
Your code will be reviewed before merging.
Please respond to feedback and make necessary changes.
